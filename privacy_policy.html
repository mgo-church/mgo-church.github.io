<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    information manually provided by members themselves.
    The Application does not access GPS, background location, or live tracking services.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Analytics and App Usage Data</h2>
  <p>
    The Application uses <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to understand general
    application usage and improve performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Firebase Analytics may automatically collect limited, non-personal information such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>App interaction events (for example, screen views)</li>
    <li>Date and time of access</li>
    <li>Device and app-related information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Service Provider does not directly collect, store, or access IP addresses
    or precise device identifiers.

<div class="section">
  <h2>Google Play Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Application uses Google Play Services and Firebase Analytics to support
    core functionality and analytics.
    These services may collect limited information in accordance with Google’s
    Privacy Policy.

  <p>
    Google Privacy Policy:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">

<div class="section">

  <ul>
    <li>Within the church community for internal coordination</li>
    <li>With trusted service providers such as Firebase Analytics for app analytics</li>
    <li>When required by law or to protect the safety and rights of users</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Account Deletion and Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Members may request to disable their access to the Application and delete their
    personal data stored within the Application by contacting the Service Provider at
    <a href="mailto:mgochurch.tambarameast@gmail.com">mgochurch.tambarameast@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon verification, the Service Provider will remove the member’s digital account
    and associated data from the Application within a reasonable time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that deleting the Application account does not automatically remove
    official church membership records that may be maintained separately for
    administrative, legal, or historical purposes.
    Such records, if any, are kept offline and are not publicly accessible.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>

    You can stop all information collection by the Application by uninstalling it
    from your mobile device using standard uninstall processes available through
    your device or application marketplace.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    The Service Provider takes reasonable measures to protect member information.
    Access to personal data is restricted to authorized church administrators only.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The Application is intended for church members and families.
    The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personal data directly from
    children under the age of 13 without parental or guardian involvement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any information related to children is provided by parents or guardians as part
    of family records. If you believe a child’s data has been included without
    consent, please contact the Service Provider for removal.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
